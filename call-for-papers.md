The [ML-DE] Workshop on "Machine Learning Meets Differential Equations: From Theory to Applications", to be held in conjunction with ECAI 2024, invites researchers and practitioners to submit their latest work on the intersection of machine learning (ML) and differential equations (DE). We welcome contributions that offer novel insights, methodologies, or applications at this interdisciplinary nexus.

#### *You are welcome to download and share the Call for Papers as a PDF document, available* <span style="background-color:red">[here](/assets/pdfs/call-for-papers-2024.pdf).</span>

## Topics of Interest

We encourage submissions across a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Embedding differential equations into machine learning frameworks (Neural ODEs, Normalising Flows, etc.)
- Machine learning approaches for solving differential equations (Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Neural Operators, etc.)
- Hybrid and augmented numerical methods for DEs leveraging ML
- Analysis and benchmarks of numerical methods integrating DE solvers with ML algorithms
- Incorporation of expert knowledge from differential equations into ML models
- Real-world applications in science, engineering, finance, biology, and more
- Utilizing ML to model systems governed by differential equations
- Methods to extract and interpret physical knowledge from learned DE models for explainable AI
- Enhancing computational efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint of DE solvers in ML applications

## Submission Formats

We invite submissions in several formats:

- **Full-Length Papers**: Up to 8 pages, excluding references and supplementary material.
- **Extended Abstracts**: 2 pages, including references, for poster sessions or elevator pitches.
- **Presentation Only**: Authors of recently published high-impact work may submit a 2-page abstract for presentation.
- **Reproducibility Track**: Interactive tutorials, demos (e.g., Jupyter notebooks), or descriptions of libraries/packages/datasets.

## Submission Guidelines
